## Source Code
Instruction on how to run developed scripts. For simplicity, we will first specify the steps neccesarry to run the evaluations on testing data on trained models. Next, we provide instructions on how to run the (1) source embedding scripts to create 5 disjoint under-sampled datasets in their embedded representation and (2) scripts that creates binary classifiers and trains on data. 

Instructions:
1. Download Google Drive Folder containing scrips and datasets. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C3zO1cC6vPRxarz8KyuS00cOOIKK1EpX?usp=sharing)
2. Copy the entire folder to your Google Drive in the following path: "/content/gdrive/MyDrive"


### How To Run Evaluations on Trained Models
  - CNN: Visit https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bp0u_lSbEkLXs0GNQ5GPc6evGP6PcIiC/view?usp=sharing in google colab and run the entire script. Note that training statements have been commented out. To train a new CNN model, simply uncomment 'history = model.fit(...)'  cells for each model
  - MLP:Similarly, visit https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BqAlpuCJNiayK0anym_yvIhERAe-dUTF/view?usp=sharing in google colab and run the entire script. Training statements have been commented, trained models have been imported. To train new MLP models, simply uncomment the 'history = model.fit(...)' cells for each model.
  - SVM:  

### How To Run Source Code Embedding Scripts




Scripts:

1. Source Code Embedding.ipynb  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TaPTvzdkj1RCGDG4tn6K6i-T8Yv8duwr?usp=sharing - This script is utilized to generate source code embeddings, undersample the dataset and create 5 different datasets per vulnerability category.
2. CNN.ipynb https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bp0u_lSbEkLXs0GNQ5GPc6evGP6PcIiC/view?usp=sharing - This script builds and trains a CNN model on the 5 CWE datasets
3. MLP.ipynb https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BqAlpuCJNiayK0anym_yvIhERAe-dUTF/view?usp=sharing This script builds and trains a MLP model on the 5 CWE datasets
