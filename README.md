## Source Code

Run your trained neural network on a single validation sample.
Instructions:
1. Download Google Drive Folder containing scrips and datasets. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XwdroF-T29BVLDWm_1IZu9Dnj7gF4uoy?usp=sharing)
2. Copy the entire folder to your Google Drive in the following path: "/content/gdrive/MyDrive"
3. Visit the following  Accuracy_Tester.ipynb on Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13SFot2wKEYnymKVW8JCeoE_1nSgiyNRv?usp=sharing
4. Run the entire file


Scripts:

1. Source Code Embedding.ipynb  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TaPTvzdkj1RCGDG4tn6K6i-T8Yv8duwr?usp=sharing - This script is utilized to generate source code embeddings, undersample the dataset and create 5 different datasets per vulnerability category.
2. CNN.ipynb https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bp0u_lSbEkLXs0GNQ5GPc6evGP6PcIiC/view?usp=sharing - This script builds and trains a CNN model on the 5 CWE datasets
3. MLP.ipynb https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BqAlpuCJNiayK0anym_yvIhERAe-dUTF/view?usp=sharing This script builds and trains a MLP model on the 5 CWE datasets
