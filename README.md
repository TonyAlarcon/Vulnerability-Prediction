## Source Code

Run your trained neural network on a single validation sample.
Instructions:
1. Download Google Drive Folder containing scrips and datasets. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XwdroF-T29BVLDWm_1IZu9Dnj7gF4uoy?usp=sharing)
2. Copy the entire folder to your Google Drive in the following path: "/content/gdrive/MyDrive"
3. Visit the following  Accuracy_Tester.ipynb on Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13SFot2wKEYnymKVW8JCeoE_1nSgiyNRv?usp=sharing
4. Run the entire file


Scripts:

1. ClutterizerV2.ipynb  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y3sqOQWPv4Ly2USbSh6jl6UMOXJjq9eE?usp=sharing - This script is utilized to generate synthetic images and their corresponding masks from the original data. Synthetic Images can be viewed here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dPMrko20-cj9y4Ew-A7OeOrUTUDbmnmQ?usp=sharing
2. Detectron.ipynb https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xoo6C9PSPPSC78DpshZsklD6aS1W_3yE/view?usp=sharing - This script is utilized to train the marskrcnn algorithm with synthetic images
3. Accuracy Tester https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13SFot2wKEYnymKVW8JCeoE_1nSgiyNRv?usp=sharing - This script is utilized to test the accuracy of the built model. Acess to GPU is a prerequesite.
